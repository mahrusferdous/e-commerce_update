# E-commerce UI

This is a e-commerce UI project that I have created using ReactJS. This project is a simple e-commerce UI that has a home page, customer management pages and a product catalog pages.

## Home Page

-   The home page has a simple design with a header and a landing welcome message.

## Customer Management Page

-   The customer page gets all the api data from the json file and displays it in a card format
-   The customer add page has a form that allows the user to add a new customer to the list
-   The customer edit page allows the user to edit the customer details
-   The customer delete page allows the user to delete the customer from the list

## Product Catalog Page

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the UI
3. Run `npm start` to start the UI
4. Run the API server by flask run command

## NOTE

-   Issues with Products API
-   Unable to add products to the cart
-   Unable to view the cart items
