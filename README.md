# E-commerce UI

This is a e-commerce UI project that I have created using ReactJS. This project is a simple e-commerce UI that has a home page, customer management pages and a product catalog pages.

## Home Page

-   The home page has a simple design with a header and a landing welcome message.

-   The customer add page has a form that allows the user to add a new customer to the list
-   The customer edit page allows the user to edit the customer details
-   The customer delete page allows the user to delete the customer from the list

## Product Catalog Page

-   The product page gets all the api data from the json file and displays it in a card format
-   The product add page has a form that allows the user to add a new customer to the list
-   The product edit page allows the user to edit the customer details
-   The product delete page allows the user to delete the customer from the list
